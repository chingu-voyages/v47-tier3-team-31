# How start

OK we have the boilerplate pushed to the repo. Everyone can clone the repo to their machine.
We have the branch called Dev (notice the capital D) which all of our features will be targetting
once you clone, switch to the cloned director. Then switch to  Dev branch using git checkout Dev.  cd into travel-event-host-app and then run  npm i to install dependencies.

Your project's `readme` is as important to success as your code. For 
this reason you should put as much care into its creation and maintenance
as you would any other component of the application.

If you are unsure of what should go into the `readme` let this article,
written by an experienced Chingu, be your starting point - 
[Keys to a well written README](https://tinyurl.com/yk3wubft).

And before we go there's "one more thing"! Once you decide what to include
in your `readme` feel free to replace the text we've provided here.
